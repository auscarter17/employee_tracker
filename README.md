  # About
    Workplace Recorder is an application you can use to manage the staff of your business. You'll be able to keep track of your departments, roles within those departments, and each employee and which role they're in. You'll also be able to keep records of each role's salary, and the reporting manager of each member of your business. You're able to edit this information as well, so that when your business is ready to expand and hire new members or create new departments and roles, you'll be able to add these into your database.
